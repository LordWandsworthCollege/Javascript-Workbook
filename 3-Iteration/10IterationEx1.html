<div id="demo">Try it </div>
<p>You are working for a payday lender. You have been asked to make a calculator for the
    website.<br> The company charges an interest rate of 5% a day. Write a program which asks
    amount the user wishes to borrow and the length of time they want to borrow it for . It
    should then tell them the total number of days
</p>

<script>
    const rate = 1.05;
    const days = parseInt(prompt("How many days do you want to borrow money for ?"));
    const amount = parseInt(prompt("and how much do you wish to borrow ?"));
    let dayX = 0;
    let repay =amount;
    while(dayX<days){
        console.log("Day "+dayX+" - "+repay);
        repay = repay*rate;
        dayX++;
    }
